# J2 Worksheet for Software Engineering
1) The int, the double, and the array are basic types, while String is an object.

2)
- A) A static method is a method that can only acess static data 
- B) AD

3) For program #1, it prints out "Wrong", For program #2, it prints out "Correct"
 
4) No, because the "season" String stays on the heap while the static method changed a different string "Str" on the stack.

5) The program would print out "X: 0 Y: 0", because you are not referencing the instance variables with the **this** keyword.

6) The *private* declaration for variables and fuctions allow for the principle of **encapuslation**, as in, information hiding through private functions vs public functions.

7) The program has some **method overloading**, the compiler would choose based on the parameters of the constructor class. For the two ints, it would choose the first constructor, for the "Point" object, it would be the second one.

8) Option #4, because we declare our variables, and use public methods

9) super(0, 0) will not compile because super must be the first line inside of the constructor. Therefore there will be no output besides a compilation error.

10) If we switch them, then it will compile as "super" is first //Need to figure this one out in more detail.

11) Option #2

12) It is used so that only classes within the *Inheiratance heirarchy* can acess the value, while outside the heirarchy, it cannot be accessed. We have it to allow for simpiler access within areas that would not break our program.

13) A

```java

public class Racecar {

    private int number; 
    private Driver driver; //assume implemented properly
    protected String sponsor = null;
    public Racecar(int n, Driver d) {
        number = n;
        driver = d;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Car #" + number + " Driver: " + driver;
    }
    
    protected addSponsor(String sp) {
        sponsor = sp;
    }
}
```

```java

public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make)
    {
        super(n, d);
        this.make = make;
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        return super.toString() + " Make: " + make;
    }
}

```
14) Neither A nor B will work
