# J2 Worksheet for Software Engineering

1) Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
```java
int a;
double b;
int c[] = {1, 2, 3};
String s = "Hello World";
```
   The int, the double, and the array are basic types, while String is an object.

2) (A) What is a static method in Java? (B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello, world");
    }
}
```

- A) A static method is a method that can only acess static data 
- B) Because static methods need to be accessed by other files and needs to access all other static methods

3) What is the output of the following programs?

```java
/* Program 1 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice == "A") {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
```java
/* Program 2 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice.equals("A")) {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```

   For program #1, it prints out "Wrong", For program #2, it prints out "Correct"
 
4) Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
```java
static void change_season(String str) {
    str = "Spring";
}

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String season = "Winter";
    change_season(season);
    System.out.println("The current season is: " + season);
}
```
No, because the "season" String stays on the heap while the static method changed a different string "Str" on the stack.

5) What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
```java
public class Point {
    double x = 0;
    double y = 0;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        x = x;
        y = y;
    }
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    Point point = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println("X: " + point.x + " Y: " + point.y);
}
```
   The program would print out "X: 0 Y: 0", because you are not referencing the instance variables with the **this** keyword.

6) What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
   
    The *private* declaration for variables and fuctions allow for the principle of **encapuslation**, as in, information hiding through private functions vs public functions.

7) In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
```java
public class Point {

   private double x, y; 
   
   public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
   }

   public Point(Point other) {
       this.x = other.getX();
       this.y = other.getY();
   }

}
```

   The program has some **method overloading**, the compiler would choose based on the parameters of the constructor class. For the two ints, it would choose the first constructor, for the "Point" object, it would be the second one.

8) For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
```java
public class Point {
   private double x,y; //the x,y fields
   public Point(double x,double y); //construct a point from an x,y
   public Point(Point other); //construct a point from another point
   public double getX(); //return the x component
   public double getY(); //return the y component
   public double setXY(double x, double y); //sets the x and y fields
   public String toString(); //return the string representation
   private double sum_x_y(); // Returns the sum of X and Y
}
```

Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis:

```java
public class CustomPoint extends Point {
    public void reflect(); // Reflects point
}
```

Which of the following implementations achieves this?

```java
 // Option 1
    public void reflect() {
        x = -x;
        y = -y;
    }

    // Option 2
    public void reflect() {
        this.x = -this.x;
        this.y = -this.y;
    }

    // Option 3
    public void reflect() {
        this = Point(-x,-y);
    }
    
    // Option 4
    public void reflect() {
        double x = -this.getX();
        double y =-this.getY();
        this.setXY(x,y);
    }
    
    // Option 5
    public void reflect() {
        x = -this.getX();
        y = -this.getY();
    }
```

   Option #4, because we declare our variables, and use public methods

9) If we add this constructor to CustomPoint:
```java
    public CustomPoint() {
        setXY(10, 10); // Line 1
        super(0, 0); // Line 2
    }
```
â€¦and then run this program, what is the output?

```java
    public static void main(final String args[]) {
        CustomPoint p = new CustomPoint();
        System.out.println(p.toString());
    }
```

   super(0, 0) will not compile because super must be the first line inside of the constructor. Therefore there will be no output besides a compilation error.
 

10) What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
    
    If we switch them, then it will compile as "super" is first //Need to figure this one out in more detail.

11) If we want to override *sum_x_y* in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)
```java
 //Option 1
    public double sum_x_y() {
        this.reflect()
        return super.sum_x_y();
    }

    //Option 2
    public double sum_x_y() {
        this.reflect();
        return this.getX() + this.getY();
    }

    //Option 3
    public double custom_sum_x_y() {
        this.reflect()
        return super.sum_x_y();
    }

    //Option 4
    public double custom_sum_x_y() {
        this.reflect();
        return this.getX() + this.getY();
    }
```
   Option #2
    

12) What is the point of the *protected* modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
    
     It is used so that only classes within the *Inheiratance heirarchy* can acess the value, while outside the heirarchy, it cannot be accessed. We have it to allow for simpiler access within areas that would not break our program.

13) Complete the constructor:
    A
```java


public class Racecar {

    private int number; 
    private Driver driver; //assume implemented properly
    protected String sponsor = null;
    public Racecar(int n, Driver d) {
        number = n;
        driver = d;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Car #" + number + " Driver: " + driver;
    }
    
    protected addSponsor(String sp) {
        sponsor = sp;
    }
}
```

```java

public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make)
    {
        super(n, d);
        this.make = make;
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        return super.toString() + " Make: " + make;
    }
}

```
14) Neither A nor B will work because we are trying to call "addSponser" when that method is protected

15) A
